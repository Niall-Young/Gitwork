description: "Mandatory safe Git completion workflow for every Codex implementation task in a project folder explicitly supplied by the runtime as currently opened or user-selected when the task creates, modifies, renames, or deletes project files. Always trigger for code, configuration, assets, dependencies, tests, build configuration, documentation, features, fixes, refactors, setup, migration, or task-requested generated project files even when the user never mentions Git or commits; this includes creating a new project in an empty or non-Git folder and tiny one-off HTML pages, scripts, demos, or prototypes. After verification, initialize Git at the selected root when needed, review task artifacts and minimal .gitignore rules, establish a reviewed baseline first when required, and commit only safely isolated current-task changes. Skip only when no project folder is explicitly supplied, the user explicitly opts out of Git operations, or the task is read-only and produces no project-file changes."

# Gitwork

Run this workflow around every qualifying task. Treat safe ownership of the commit as more important than forcing a commit.

## Gate Git operations

Perform this gate before running any Git command:

1. Confirm that the Codex runtime explicitly supplies a user-selected project/workspace folder. Do not infer a project from the shell working directory, code in the conversation, or generated temporary files.
2. Ignore Codex-managed internal locations such as `~/.codex/visualizations`. If there is no unambiguous user-selected project folder, stop this workflow without running `git init`, `git add`, or `git commit`.
3. Use the selected folder itself as the only project root. Do not inherit a Git repository above it, search for repositories below it, or operate on paths outside it.
4. Continue only when the task will create, modify, rename, or delete files inside that root. Skip read-only, explanation, research, planning, and review tasks.

## Establish the baseline

Run this at the start of the task, before editing files:

1. Resolve the canonical project-root path.
2. Recognize an existing repository only when `<project-root>/.git` exists as a directory or file. When it exists, verify that `git -C <project-root> rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to the same canonical root. Stop and report an unsafe mismatch.
3. For an existing repository, record the current branch, operation state, `git status --short`, staged paths, unstaged paths, untracked paths, and relevant diffs. Do not alter the user's index while recording the baseline.
4. Do not create a routine task commit during an unresolved merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, or detached-HEAD state. Let a task explicitly handling that Git operation own its completion; otherwise report the condition.
5. When the project root has no `.git`, initialize exactly there with `git init -b main`. Never initialize a parent or child directory.

For a newly initialized repository with existing files:

1. Inspect the complete file list and create or minimally extend `.gitignore` for the detected stack. Exclude local environment files, credentials and private keys, dependency directories, caches, logs, generated output, and build artifacts. Preserve deliberate example files such as `.env.example`.
2. Review every candidate before staging. Do not stage secrets, unexpectedly large binaries, generated dependencies, or files outside the project root.
3. Stage the reviewed baseline. This is the only phase where `git add -A` is allowed, and only after the safety review and ignore rules are in place.
4. Inspect the staged names and diff, then commit `chore: 初始化 Git 仓库` when committable files exist. Do not create an empty baseline commit.
5. If Git identity, hooks, or another Git error prevents the baseline commit, do not bypass it or invent identity values. Continue the requested work when safe, but report that automatic committing is blocked.

## Review task-created artifacts

Perform this review after implementation and verification and before staging a task commit:

1. Build a complete inventory of paths created, modified, renamed, or deleted by the current task. Compare task activity with the recorded baseline and inspect the final status with untracked paths expanded. Include task-created paths that an existing ignore rule already hides. Do not treat files that were already untracked or dirty at baseline as task-owned.
2. Classify every task-owned path as either a required project change or a local-only artifact. Treat test packages, build output, dependency directories, caches, logs, temporary files, editor state, and plugin working files as local-only unless the user request or established repository convention explicitly requires them to be versioned.
3. For each task-created, untracked local-only artifact, first run `git check-ignore -v -- <path>`. When an existing rule matches, keep that rule unchanged and do not add a duplicate.
4. When no rule matches, minimally append a rule to the project-root `.gitignore`. Preserve all existing content and user edits. Use a root-anchored exact path for a single artifact or an uncertain classification; use a directory-level rule only when the directory is a confirmed conventional output location for the detected tool. Never add a broad wildcard that could hide source files.
5. Run `git check-ignore -v -- <path>` again for every new rule and confirm that it matches the intended artifact. Keep the ignored artifact on disk; do not delete it.
6. Treat only the lines added to `.gitignore` by this task as task-owned. Include those lines in the task commit. If `.gitignore` was dirty at baseline, stage only clearly separable task lines; if they cannot be isolated safely, do not create the task commit and explain why.
7. When a local-only artifact was already tracked at baseline, do not add an ineffective ignore rule, run `git rm --cached`, or stage its task-time modification. Leave it tracked, report it as an uncommitted issue, and let the user decide whether to change the repository policy.
8. Repeat the candidate-path review after updating `.gitignore`. Confirm that every task-created path is either selected for the commit, demonstrably ignored, or explicitly reported as an already tracked artifact.

## Finish and isolate task changes

Complete the requested implementation and its proportionate verification before committing.

1. Compare the final state with the recorded baseline. If the task produced no project-file changes, do not create a commit.
2. Select only required project files, task-owned hunks, and task-owned `.gitignore` additions identified by the artifact review. Exclude unrelated user changes and all local-only artifacts. Do not use `git add .` or `git add -A` for a task commit.
3. When a task touches a file that was already dirty, stage only clearly separable task hunks. If any required task change cannot be separated reliably, do not create an incomplete or mixed commit; leave the task changes uncommitted and explain the conflict.
4. Preserve unrelated staged entries. When unrelated content is already staged and the task paths are wholly task-owned, use a path-limited commit such as `git commit --only ... -- <task-paths>` so the existing index content is not included.
5. Inspect task-scoped staged names, `git diff --cached --check`, the diff stat, and the actual diff. Confirm that the commit contains the complete task and its required ignore rules, contains no local-only artifact, and includes nothing else.

## Write the commit message

Create one task commit using exactly `<type>: <中文说明>`. Omit scope and trailing punctuation. Choose the type that best represents the primary user-visible outcome:

- `feat`: add capability or behavior
- `fix`: correct a defect
- `refactor`: restructure code without changing behavior
- `perf`: improve performance
- `test`: change tests only
- `docs`: change documentation only
- `build`: change dependencies or build tooling
- `ci`: change continuous-integration configuration
- `style`: change formatting only
- `chore`: perform maintenance not covered above
- `revert`: revert an earlier change

Keep the Chinese subject concise and specific, for example `feat: 添加批量导出功能` or `fix: 修复登录状态丢失问题`.

Run normal Git hooks. Never use `--no-verify`, create an empty commit, amend an existing commit, rewrite history, or push unless the user explicitly asks. If a hook fails, fix only in-scope failures, re-stage the task changes, and retry; otherwise leave the changes uncommitted and report the failure.

## Report the result

After a successful commit:

1. Read the short commit hash and subject from `HEAD`.
2. Run `git status --short` and distinguish remaining user changes from task leftovers.
3. Report the hash, commit subject, verification performed, ignore rules added or reused for task-created artifacts, any tracked artifacts left uncommitted, and any other remaining uncommitted changes.

If no commit was created, state the exact reason. Never claim success from `git commit` output without verifying `HEAD`.
